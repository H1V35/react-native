# Pokedex App

## üò∫ Description

Pokedex App is a native Android and iOS application built with React Native and Expo using TypeScript. It provides a comprehensive database of Pok√©mon, including their stats, abilities, and other relevant information. The app includes several key screens:

- Pok√©mon List
- Pok√©mon Search
- Pok√©mon Detail Page

The information for each Pok√©mon is fetched from the API [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

## üßû Requirements

The following requirements and guidelines were followed to achieve the functionality of the app:

- Utilize React Native with navigaton for smooth transitions between screens, a store, and native components.
- Make API requests using Axios and TanStack Query.
- Implement a responsive UI that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.

## üì± Screens

### Pok√©mon List

- Home screen to show all existing pokemons in the pokedex.
- Asynchronously loading Pok√©mon information in a paginated list. The list dynamically loads as the user scrolls vertically (infinite scroll).
- Redirects to the Pok√©mon Search Page by clicking the search icon.
- Redirects to the Pok√©mon Detail Page by clicking a Pok√©mon in the list.

### Pok√©mon Search

- Allows users to search for Pok√©mon by name or ID.
- Applies a debounce function to prevent excessive API requests while typing.

### Pok√©mon Detail Page

- Display detailed information about the selected Pok√©mon, including its stats, abilities, and type.
- Showcase an image and sprites of the Pok√©mon.
